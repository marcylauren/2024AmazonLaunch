        <h1> Information</h1>
        <P>Approximately 65% of homeless women suffer from mental illness, with nearly half experiencing major
          depressive disorder, a rate double that of the general female population. Homeless women are more prone than
          men to trauma, assault, and PTSD due to the lack of stable housing.</P>
        <h3><mark>Challenges Women Face</mark></h3>
        <p><b>1- Prostitution</b><br>
        Women face sexual assault, physical and domestic violence as homeless. They are often forced to take up prostitution or they end up trading themselves. For instance, women have reported sexual assault in showers and public restrooms.</p>

        <p><b>2- Deteriorating health during reproductive years and Menopause</b><br>
        Homeless women lack preventive care such as prenatal, mammograms and other tests.The rate of unintended pregnancies is higher in homeless women who have no access to contraceptives.As a result, there is a much higher rate of abortions, abnormalities and adverse birth outcomes.</p>

        <p><b>3- Access to menstrual products is limited</b><br>
        For homeless women, menstrual cycles are a monthly challenge to survival.  Most of the shelters do not provide menstrual products such as pads or tampons A box of pad can cost anywhere around $ 5 to $ 10 plus taxes.</p>

          <p><b>4-Lack of Maternal health care plans</b><br>
        Most of the unintended pregnancies happen inside homeless shelters where a lot of women are forced to have sexual intercourse.</p>

            <p><b>5-Lack of Safety and Security</b><br>
        Women and children fleeing domestic violence from an abusive partner often face disappointment as homeless. The streets make women even more vulnerable for abuse and violence from strangers. Homeless women are an easy prey as half of them would never report rape and sexual abuse owning to their own insecurities.</p>

              <p><b>6-Gender inequality in jobs</b><br>
        We cannot deny the fact that gender disparity and sexism does exists in our nation. Additionally, more than half of the homeless women do not have a high school degree which makes them less likely to attain a stable source of income.</p>

                <p><b>7-Extreme Depression</b><br>
        About 1 in 4 homeless people face extreme mental issues which goes untreated. In other words, 47% of homeless women meet the criteria for a major depressive disorder alone, which is twice the rate of women in the general population.</p>

                  <p><b>8-Victimization</b><br>
        Homeless women are particularly vulnerable to multiple forms of victimization. Subsequently, the shelters for women are unsafe and they have reported extreme physical and mental violence inside the safe home</p>
